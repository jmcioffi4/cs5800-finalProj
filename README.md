# cs5800-finalProj

## Before Running the Program
*   The user of the program must open MySQL Workbench and run the `create.sql` and then the `insert.sql` files in order for the program to work.
    *   These are located in the `SQL` directory

## The Entry Point to the Program
*   The entry point to the program is `terminal.py` located in `src/`

## Running `terminal.py`
*   `python3` is probably how you use `python` on your command line, if this is not the case, enter in your computer's python command to run `terminal.py`
    *   Ex: `python3 terminal.py`
*   `INPUT` is asking for a valid input from the user (what does the user want to see)
    *   type `help` to see a list of available inputs.
*   a valid `USAGE MESSAGE` will pop up with relevant information if an error occurs
    *   this will clear the user's screen to ensure a clean UI environment
