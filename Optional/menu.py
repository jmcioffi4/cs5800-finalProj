    # TODO : Create a menu option to view database information (both player and developer view); this option will lead to calling terminal() (from viewSQLDB) in main with how it is currently set up.

    # TODO : Create a menu option to modify the database information

    # TODO : Create a menu option to exit the program

    # IDEA? : Create two menu options, Player View and DeveloperView. (Would need to refactor viewSQLDB.py in this case)
