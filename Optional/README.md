In this directory, you must have all 
your code and executables (if necessary) for the optional parts. You should include a 
readme file along with the code. Readme file must include which systems (with the 
versions) are required to run the code; as well as the step-by-step instructions on how to 
run your code. If the code does not run with your instructions, I will notify you with an 
email, and you (all project group) should come to my office on December 16th (between 
11:00 - 14:30). You will have 30 minutes to show me how it works (you can only use the 
code you have submitted.)
