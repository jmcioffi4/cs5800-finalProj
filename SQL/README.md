SQL/ folder: Create a folder called "SQL", and put three files in this directory.  
○ The first file should be named as "create.sql" and it must include DDL 
commands, such as create and alter table statements. Also it should include the 
index creation statements if you have indexes in your database.  
○ The second one should be names as "queries.sql". In this file you must have the 
SQL queries, that refers to the functional requirements you have listed in your 
project reports. Comment and format both of the files, properly. If your SQL file 
does not show which functional requirement it addresses, it will not be graded. 
○ The third file must be named as "insert.sql", it should have the insert table 
statements. I will only run "create.sql" and "insert.sql" once (and as a whole); and 
check whether your functional requirements work properly. Therefore, test all 
your code; make sure it runs correctly. (An alternative to the insert.sql is to save 
a database instance and send me that particular instance. In this alternative, you 
must send me a readme file, that shows exactly which commands I should run).
